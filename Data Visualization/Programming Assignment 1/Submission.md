# Data Visualization: Programming Assignment 1 Submission

## Overview
This file implements [Programming Assignment 1: Visualize Data Using a Chart](https://github.com/pauldeng/MOOC/blob/master/Data%20Visualization/Programming%20Assignment%201/README.md) for the Coursera [Data Visualization](https://class.coursera.org/datavisualization-001) Class, Aug 2015.

## The Data
Data is extracted from [NASA GISTEMP Table Data: Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)

## Tool Used
* Excel 2013 (I know, hopefully I will use D3 or Tableau next time)

## Submission
![Image of Global Annual Mean Temperature Difference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauldeng/MOOC/master/Data%20Visualization/Programming%20Assignment%201/Global%20Annual%20Mean%20Temperature%20Difference.png).

This graph visualizes the GISTEMP data for the Globe and the North and South Hemispheres through all the given years. The Green line describes the data for the Northern Hemisphere, the Red for the South Hemisphere, and the Green line is for the Globe.

1. What are your X and Y axes?
   * Answer: X is the years since 1880 to 2014; Y is the temperature deviation in 0.01 C.
2. Did you use a subset of the data? If so, what was it?
   * Answer: Yes, I only used the first 3 columns of file ExcelFormattedGISTEMPData2CSV.csv.
3. Are there any particular aspects of your visualization to which you would like to bring attention?
   * Answer: Global warming is a fact, go green people :)
4. What do you think the data, and your visualization, shows?
   * Answer: This work is a reproduce of Sample Submission 2 with minor fix. Hope next time with more knowledge learned from this course, I can create better and creative visualization. 

## Thank you for your time :)
